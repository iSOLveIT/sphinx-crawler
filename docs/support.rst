=======

The easiest way to get help with the project is to join the ``#crawler`` channel on `Freenode`_.

We hang out there and you can get real-time help with your projects.
The other good way is to open an issue on `Github`_.

The mailing list at `https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/crawler`_
is also available for support.
